Export Org-mode files as editable web pages                -*- org -*-

org-ehtml serves Org-mode files as editable web pages using an elnode
Emacs web server for server-side processing and Javascript for
interaction through the browser.

Follow these steps to try this out locally.  Note that you will need a
very recent version of elnode in your load path.  Elnode can be
obtained from http://nicferrier.github.com/elnode/.

1. Load the required libraries.
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (require 'org-ehtml-client)
     (require 'org-ehtml-server)
     (require 'test-org-ehtml)
   #+end_src

2. Run the tests to make sure everything is working.
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (ert 'org-ethml)
   #+end_src

3. Set the root of your directory of Org-mode files.  For now we'll
   just use the example files used in the tests, later you can
   customize this variable.
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (setq org-ehtml-docroot test-org-ehtml-example-dir)
   #+end_src

4. Start up elnode.
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (elnode-start 'org-ehtml-server-dispatcher-handler)
   #+end_src

5. Point your browser to http://localhost:8000/simple.org and move
   your mouse over the page.  Editable portions of the page will be
   highlighted, click on these to edit.
