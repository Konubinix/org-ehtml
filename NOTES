* suggestions on testing from nicferrier
: 15:29 < nicferrier> _schulte_:
:                     https://github.com/nicferrier/elnode/blob/master/elnode-client.el#L534
: 15:29 < _schulte_> nicferrier: great, thanks
: 15:29 < nicferrier> beware, that module has had a lot removed from it - the child emacs
:                     stuff has been removed to this rle module I'm working on
: 15:30 < nicferrier> but that test should hold up. it works in my automated tests anyway.
: 15:30 < nicferrier> having said that, the fakir stuff is really very good, it's mostly a
:                     full stack test.
: 15:31 < nicferrier> just uses a fake process.
: ...
: 15:34 < _schulte_> oh, turns out `sit-for' was all I needed (for my very simple test)

: 15:35 < nicferrier> _schulte_: if you're gonna do this you might also be interested in my
:                     phantomjs stuff - let's you test elnode apps in a headless browser.

* authentication with elnode
#+begin_quote nicferrier
I have the code in a branch on github. There is an example of doing
authentication here:

https://github.com/nicferrier/elnode/blob/auth/elnode-wiki.el#L240

that shows how to set up a declared authentication scheme which can then
be used to protect bits of code.
